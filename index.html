Later, riding behind you on your Activa for the first time, the world felt smaller, warmer, and somehow entirely ours. And when you dropped me off, that firm handshake we shared spoke volumes—more than words ever could. It was a simple gesture, but it told me everything: connection, trust, comfort, and a hint of something magical I hadn’t felt before.

That night, I discovered how naturally we fit together, how small moments become unforgettable with you, and how every touch, every glance, every shared silence quietly writes our story.`,
